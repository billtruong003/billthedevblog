# About

🌟 Welcome to **Bill The Dev Lab** — I’m **Bill The Dev**, a passionate 🎮 game developer, technical artist, and 👨‍🏫 educator based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

With over **2 years of experience in Unity game development** and more than **3 years in teaching**, I’ve been able to blend my love for technology, creativity, and education into something truly meaningful. I’m constantly pushing the boundaries of game design and technical art, aiming to create immersive, interactive worlds while helping others learn along the way.

## My Journey in Game Development 🎨
I thrive on creative and technical challenges, whether I’m working on gameplay mechanics, tools development, or 3D modeling. I’m driven by a relentless curiosity and passion for exploring **new technologies** and improving my skills.

I’ve had the opportunity to participate in some incredible events and challenges, including:
- **[GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)**: Together with fellow devlogtubers **SoraTheDev** and **NdDevGame**, we created the game *[Puffy](https://soratheweeb.itch.io/puffy-gmtk-jam-2024)* for **GMTK Jam 2024**. This project allowed me to experiment and collaborate in exciting ways, further igniting my love for game development.
- **[Korea and Viet Game Contest](https://link-to-the-contest.com)**: I was part of this competition with my project *[DragSlice: Culinary Journey](https://billtruong003.itch.io/dragslice-culinary-journey)*, a game that showcased my approach to innovative gameplay mechanics.


These contests have allowed me to sharpen my skills, work with talented individuals, and contribute to the **game development community in Vietnam**, where I’m known as **Bill The Dev**.

## My Focus Areas 🧠
I’m deeply passionate about game development, technical art, and tools creation. I’m always exploring **cutting-edge technologies** and pushing myself to be better. I take pride in being an **avid self-learner**, gaining knowledge through personal projects, research, and hands-on experience.

One of my key interests is **3D modeling**, especially in **low-poly design** and **shader development**. There’s something incredibly satisfying about bringing a 3D environment to life, from creating assets to working on the finer details that enhance the artistic and technical aspects of a game world.

## Teaching & Mentorship 📚
With over **2,500 hours of teaching experience**, I’ve had the privilege of mentoring students and guiding them through programming and game design. Seeing them succeed in both local and international competitions has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career. I’m passionate about creating **educational tools** and helping others unlock their full potential in tech and creativity.

## My Tech Stack 💻:
- **Unity 3D** 🕹️
- **CSharp** ⚙️
- **Git, GitHub, GitLab** 🔧
- **Agile & Scrum methodologies** 📈

## What’s Next? 🚀
I’m always on the lookout for **new challenges**. Whether it's developing a new game concept, joining a game jam, or diving deeper into technical art, I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and contributing to the world of game development.
