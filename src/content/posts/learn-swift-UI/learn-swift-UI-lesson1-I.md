# Speedrun Swift UI Lesson 1 - Part I: Introduction to Basic Swift Concepts

## I. Getting Familiar with Basic Swift

In this part, we will introduce the core elements of Swift, a powerful programming language developed by Apple. Mastering these basics is essential for anyone who wants to develop Swift applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, or tvOS.

### Topics Covered:
- **Variables and Constants (`var` and `let`)**: Learn the differences between mutable and immutable data.
- **Swift's Basic Data Types**: Understand how Swift stores and handles different kinds of data.
- **Conditional Statements**: Control the flow of your code using `if` and `switch`.
- **Practice Exercises**: Sharpen your skills with practical coding challenges.

### 1.1. Variables and Constants in Swift

#### What is a Variable?

In Swift, **variables** are containers that can store values, and those values can change over time. You declare a variable using the `var` keyword.

```swift
var message = "Hello, Swift!"  // This is a variable
message = "Hello, World!"      // Value can be changed
print(message)  // Output: Hello, World!
```

- **Why use variables?**
  Variables are useful when you need to keep track of changing information such as user input, scores in a game, or the current state of an app.

#### What is a Constant?

A **constant**, on the other hand, is a container for data that cannot change once it has been set. Constants are declared using the `let` keyword.

```swift
let pi = 3.14159  // This is a constant
// pi = 3.14  // Error: Cannot change a constant's value once assigned
print(pi)  // Output: 3.14159
```

- **Why use constants?**
  Constants are ideal when working with values that should never change after being set, such as mathematical constants or configuration settings.

### Differences Between Variables and Constants

1. **Mutability**:
   - A variable (`var`) can be changed after its initial assignment.
   - A constant (`let`) cannot be changed once it's been initialized.

2. **Use Cases**:
   - Use variables when the value is expected to change over time.
   - Use constants when the value should remain fixed throughout the program.

### Example: Calculating Circle Area

```swift
let radius = 5.0  // A constant
var area = 3.14159 * radius * radius  // Using the constant in a variable
print("The area of the circle is \(area)")
```

### 1.2. Swiftâ€™s Basic Data Types

#### Swift is a **strongly-typed** language, meaning that every variable or constant must have a specific data type. Here are some of the most commonly used data types:

1. **Int**: Stores whole numbers.
   ```swift
   var age: Int = 25
   ```

2. **Double**: Stores decimal numbers (floating-point).
   ```swift
   var height: Double = 1.75
   ```

3. **String**: Stores text.
   ```swift
   var name: String = "Alice"
   ```

4. **Bool**: Stores Boolean values (`true` or `false`).
   ```swift
   var isLoggedIn: Bool = true
   ```

### Type Inference

Swift can automatically infer the type of a variable or constant based on the value you assign to it. You don't always need to explicitly declare the type.

```swift
var score = 100  // Swift knows this is an Int
var temperature = 37.5  // Swift knows this is a Double
```

### 1.3. Conditional Statements: `if` and `switch`

#### Controlling the Flow of Code with `if`

The `if` statement in Swift allows you to execute a block of code based on a specific condition. If the condition is true, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.

```swift
let temperature = 30

if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's a hot day!")
} else {
    print("It's a cool day!")
}
```

- **Explanation**: The program checks if the temperature is greater than 25. If the condition is true, it prints "It's a hot day!", otherwise it prints "It's a cool day!".

#### Example: Nested `if-else`

```swift
let grade = 85

if grade >= 90 {
    print("You got an A!")
} else if grade >= 80 {
    print("You got a B!")
} else {
    print("Keep improving!")
}
```

- **Explanation**: Based on the value of `grade`, the program prints different messages. This is useful for grading systems, user permissions, and more.

#### Using `switch` for Multiple Cases

The `switch` statement allows you to check multiple possible values for a single variable.

```swift
let dayOfWeek = 3

switch dayOfWeek {
case 1:
    print("It's Monday")
case 2:
    print("It's Tuesday")
case 3:
    print("It's Wednesday")
default:
    print("Unknown day")
}
```

- **Explanation**: The `switch` statement matches the `dayOfWeek` value with the cases and executes the corresponding block of code.

#### Example: Using `switch` with Ranges

```swift
let score = 85

switch score {
case 90...100:
    print("Excellent!")
case 80..<90:
    print("Good job!")
case 70..<80:
    print("You passed!")
default:
    print("Keep trying!")
}
```

- **Explanation**: The `switch` statement can also work with ranges, which is useful when dealing with grades, age ranges, or levels in a game.

### Exercises

1. **Age Checker**: Write a program that checks a person's age and prints whether they are eligible to vote (>= 18 years old).

   ```swift
   let age = 17
   if age >= 18 {
       print("You can vote!")
   } else {
       print("You're too young to vote.")
   }
   ```

2. **Day of the Week**: Write a program using `switch` to print the name of the day of the week based on an integer value from 1 to 7.

   ```swift
   let day = 5
   switch day {
   case 1:
       print("Sunday")
   case 2:
       print("Monday")
   case 3:
       print("Tuesday")
   case 4:
       print("Wednesday")
   case 5:
       print("Thursday")
   case 6:
       print("Friday")
   case 7:
       print("Saturday")
   default:
       print("Invalid day")
   }
   ```
